##### OneDriveHealthSyncReport.ps1
Script to export a report of devices with OneDrive sync errors from the OneDrive Sync health dashboard. You will require a Bearer token, more details on obtaining this can be found in the script.

You can read more about this in my post - https://www.iainborghoff.com/2022/january/exporting-onedrive-sync-health-reports

**I wont be updating this script to fix the issues of it not returning any results - Please use the Get-OneDriveSyncReport.ps1 function.**
